# Homelab Purpose

Homelab serves as a hands-on learning and development environment for exploring the world of infrastructure management.
The main goals of this lab are to:
1. Test and experiment with various Dev/Sec/ML-Ops'ish and infrastructure management tools and technologies, simulating real-world production environments.
2. Construct and maintain a highly available and scalable infrastructure.

Key areas of focus include:
1. **Monitoring**: Implementing systems to monitor infrastructure and applications, ensuring reliability and top performance.
2. **Contenerization**: Utilizing Docker, Swarm, LXC / LXD and K8s for managing containerized applications, ensuring portability and efficient resource utilization.
3. **IaaC (Infrastructure as Code)**: Implementing automation and configuration management tools to streamline infrastructure deployment and management, promoting consistency and reducing human error.
4. **Security**: Ensuring the lab's security through best practices and monitoring, including data encryption and access control.
5. **Self-Healing**: Automating issue detection and resolution to promote high availability and stability.
